# MATLAB Markdown Writer

Helper class for writing markdown files directly from MATLAB, including figures, tables, structs and arrays that are properly markdown formatted. 

For a quick start on how to use the markdown writer see [Examples/example.m](Examples/example.m), simply run this file from within Matlab and take a look at the produced *Examples/example.md* markdown file.

For working with template markdown files see [Examples/exampleTemplate.m](Examples/exampleTemplate.m) and [Examples/exampleTemplate.md](Examples/exampleTemplate.md), simply run this file from within Matlab and take a look at the produced *Examples/exampleTemplateFilled.md* markdown file.
